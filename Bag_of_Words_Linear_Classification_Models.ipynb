    "### The learning curve above shows among others that, when the training sample size is relatively small (100 ~ 2000), there is a large gap between the training score and cross-validation score. This is to be expected, since a reasonable learning model won't have much trouble fitting a small set of training data very well, but will likely not generalize well to the testing data due to the small sample size. Conversely, when the training sample size gets larger, the model is more likely to learn the vicissitudes (e.g. noise, etc.) of the training data and generalize better. Sure enough, as the training instances get larger, the gap between the two scores decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall, however, this learning curve may have a slight over-fitting (high variance) problem; even as the gap decreases towards the right side of the curve, the scores remain fairly far apart at the end (~0.97 vs ~0.86). It is possible that the scores will converge further given a larger sample size; we may also try introducing different levels of bias into our model to see if it results in better convergence."
